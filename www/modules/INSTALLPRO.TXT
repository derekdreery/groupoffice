Thank you for purchasing Group-Office Professional! 
We hope you will enjoy it.

INSTALLATION

If this is a fresh installation simply follow the instructions written in
groupoffice-pro-x/INSTALL.TXT

To install ActiveSync support read:

groupoffice-pro-x/modules/sync/z-push/INSTALL.TXT


UPGRADE COMMUNITY TO PROFESSIONAL VERSION

If you already run the community version simply replace the files and run Group-Office. The system update should complete without errors.

After that login as admin to install the professional modules at: 

Start menu -> Modules -> Install 


Note: if you installed using the Debian packages you should not use this package. Instead put the license files in /usr/share/groupoffice and run:

apt-get install groupoffice-pro
