First, download and install Mediawiki using their installation instructions. In
order for the integration of Mediawiki in Group-Office to work, Mediawiki MUST
be installed at the same host as Group-Office. To integrate Mediawiki with
Group-Office, do the following:

1. Inside this module's subdirectory /plugin, you will find GO_Plugin.php and
   iAuthPlugin.php. Copy these files inside the /extensions directory of your
   Mediawiki installation.

2. You will also find LocalSettings.php inside /plugin. Either overwrite the
   existing LocalSettings.php in your Mediawiki root with it, or put the part
   designated as necessary for Group-Office at the end of the existing
   LocalSettings.php.

3. Make sure the Mediawiki module is installed in Group-Office, and, as admin,
   set the full Mediawiki URL in the Group-Office Mediawiki Administration. If
   Group-Office and Mediawiki share the same host, and the URL is correct, you
   should immediately see Mediawiki, where your GO user settings are
   automatically transferred to Mediawiki.
