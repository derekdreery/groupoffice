Everything in classes should be moved to the go folder and be autoloaded so no 
require functions are needed anymore.

All json.php and action.php files should be replaced by models and controllers.

All the language files should be made in php files. Javascript language can be 
generated from them.

All the javascript should be moved to a view so that for example a pure html or ipad view
could be made parallel.

default_script.inc.php belongs to the view and is ugly. It should be redesigned.
