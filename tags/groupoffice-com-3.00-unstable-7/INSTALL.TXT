!!! READ THE RELEASE NOTES !!!


 

UPGRADING FROM VERSION 2.x

First backup your database!

Upgrading from version 2 is a little bit trickier. There is a special upgrade script 
for version 2.18 only. So if you run a version prior to version 2.18 you must first 
download 2.18 from Sourceforge and upgrade to that version. It doesn't matter if you 
use the Professional or the Community version. You can always use the 2.18 Community 
version for the upgrade purpose.

After this you must check your database encoding. Older MySQL versions did not 
support UTF8 encoding. Therefore the database from older Group-Office installations
does not handle non-ascii characters very well. We created a script to correct this 
database. Check with PhpMyAdmin or another tool if your database uses the right encoding.
You should see utf8_general_ci encoding and not latin1_swedish_ci or any other.
To convert latin encoding to utf8 run the script install/convertDbToUTF8.sh

eg.: 
./convertDbToUTF8.sh databasename "-u root --password=yourmysqlpass"

This should convert it for you.

Now your database can be converted to a Group-Office 3.0 database.

Put your old config.php file in the root of the new Group-Office 3.0 directory. Adjust the paths in the file if necessary.

Run this query on your database:

RENAME TABLE `modules`  TO `go_modules` ;

Do not run install/index.php! Run install/upgrade2to3.php in your browser. This will take some time but 
when it's finished without problems, you are ready to run Group-Office 3.0!

If you see errors because of a duplicate entry like this:

MySQL Error: 1062 (Duplicate entry ...)

Then you can ignore them. Any other error can not be ignored.



SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-Linux (Others might work but I never tested it) 
-PHP5.2 compiled with:
	-IMAP extension for e-mail module and IMAP authentication
	-MySQL extension
-MySQL 5 or higher

Good luck!
