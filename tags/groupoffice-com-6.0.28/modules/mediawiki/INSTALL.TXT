First, download and install Mediawiki using their installation instructions. In
order for the integration of Mediawiki in Group-Office to work, Mediawiki MUST
be installed at the same host as Group-Office. To integrate Mediawiki with
Group-Office, do the following:

1. Copy modules/mediawiki/extensions/GOAuth.php to the extensions directory of
   mediawiki.

2. Add the following line to the LocalSettings.php file of mediawiki:

require_once("$IP/extensions/GOAuth.php");

3. Make sure the Mediawiki module is installed in Group-Office, and, as admin,
   set the full Mediawiki URL in the Group-Office Mediawiki Administration. If
   Group-Office and Mediawiki share the same host, and the URL is correct, you
   should immediately see Mediawiki, where your GO user settings are
   automatically transferred to Mediawiki.
