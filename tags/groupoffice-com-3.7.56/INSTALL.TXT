Thank you for installing Group-Office! We hope you will enjoy it.

INSTALLATION
To install Group-Office open a browser and go to the URL where you put the 
Group-Office files and follow instructions.

Also have a look at: http://www.group-office.com/wiki/Installation_manual

If you are using the Professional version you also need to install the free
Ioncube loaders. Download them from:

http://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php


UPGRADE FROM VERSION 3.0 TO FUTURE VERSIONS:
http://www.group-office.com/wiki/Upgrading
 

UPGRADING FROM VERSION 2.x

First backup your database!

Upgrading from version 2 is a little bit trickier. There is a special upgrade script 
for version 2.18 to 3.x only. So if you run a version prior to version 2.18 you must first
download 2.18 and 3.x from Sourceforge:

https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=76359&package_id=77805

and upgrade to that version. It doesn't matter if you 
use the Professional or the Community version. You can always use the 2.18 Community 
version for the upgrade purpose.

After this you must check your database encoding. Older MySQL versions did not 
support UTF8 encoding. Therefore the database from older Group-Office installations
does not handle non-ascii characters very well. We created a script to correct this 
database. Check with PhpMyAdmin or another tool if your database uses the right encoding.
You should see utf8_general_ci encoding and not latin1_swedish_ci or any other.
To convert latin encoding to utf8 run the script install/convertDbToUTF8.sh

eg.: 
./convertDbToUTF8.sh databasename "-u root --password=yourmysqlpass"

This should convert it for you.

Now your database can be converted to a Group-Office 3.x database.

Put your old config.php file in the root of the new Group-Office 3.x directory. Adjust the paths in the file if necessary.

Then it's wise to create another backup in case anything goes wrong in the upgrade2to3.php script.

Run install/upgrade2to3/upgrade2to3.php in your browser.

This will take some time.

If you see errors because of a duplicate entry like this:

MySQL Error: 1062 (Duplicate entry ...) or Table or Column already exist.

Then you can ignore them. Any other error can not be ignored.

Now run install/index.php

Login to Group-Office and run a database check at Start menu -> System tools.
If system tools is not there install the module.

Now it should be done!
