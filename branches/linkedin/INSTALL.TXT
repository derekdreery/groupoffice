** LinkedIn module installation & Product registration **

1) Go to http://developer.linkedin.com/. Log in using your
LinkedIn account, click on 'API keys' in the account menu. You can then register
your Group-Office installation there by adding an application. Note that in the
registration form, you do not need to fill in the fields under OAuth User
Agreement for the intended LinkedIn contact import function to work. During
registration, you receive the API key and Secret key specific for your
Group-Office installation.

2) In your Group-Office config.php, create the lines
$config['linkedin_api_key'] = 'abcd123456';
$config['linkedin_secret_key'] = 'efgh987654';
and replace the values by the API key and Secret key from the previous
registration step.
